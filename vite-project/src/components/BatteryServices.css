/*
  The `card-glow` class and its associated hover effects
  (transition, transform: translateY, box-shadow)
  should be defined globally (e.g., in index.css or Home.css)
  to ensure consistency and avoid repetition.
  Example of what card-glow might contain:
*/
/*
.card-glow {
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
.card-glow:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);
  box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(127, 255, 0, 0.4);
  border-color: rgba(127, 255, 0, 0.7); // If border is part of the glow effect
}
*/

/* Ensure paragraph text in cards has good leading */
.card-glow p {
    line-height: 1.65; /* Example, adjust as needed */
}
